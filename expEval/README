The following files are for an Expression Evaluation application.
This application when run will evaluate an inputted expression that
contains a variable 'x', then evaluates the expression for different
variables of 'x'.

For example: x + 5

A user is required to enter three numbers, one acting as the minimum, one action
as the maximum, and the last acting as the increment.
The application shall then evaluate the expression, incrementing up until it
either equals or exceeds the inputted maximum value entered.

This application was made with plugins in mind: 
- one to show a progress bar as the expressions run
- one to that saves the results to a CSV file
- one to add in both Fibonacci and Factorial options for expressions
- one to add in a progress bar, but coded to interact with code in C++



Note: When running this using gradlew run, please use the following
command:

for Linux/unix: ./gradlew -q run --console=plain

for windows: gradlew -q run --console=plain

This will result in the output not being cluttered by
the gradle running task bars.

The names of the Plugins are as follows:
Progress tracker: ProgBar

Saving results to CSV File: SaveCSV

Adding Factorial / Fibonacci functionality: FibFact

Adding Function programmed in C: CProgBar


Search the cli file to find Result.csv if using SaveCSV
